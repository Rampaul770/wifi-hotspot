Portable Hotspot
================

A simple MS-DOS batch file to create a portable wireless hotspot on Windows.

Most laptop wifi modules have hosted network support built-in. But Windows does not natively support it.
This batch file will make setting up hotspots faster, at zero cost and minimal effort.

<strong>How it works</strong><br>
It calls netsh start hosted network command.
The file will have to be run in Administrator mode - Right-click and select "Run as Administrator"

<strong>How to configure hotspot</strong><br>
Edit the Name and Password in the file.
